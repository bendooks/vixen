Reverse engineering a VIC-20 RAM expansion
==========================================

This is a project to reverse engineer a Commodore VIC-20 memory expansion
from the old 8-bit computer days. This repository has several versions of
the board, a talk describing the process and related documentation.

The [talk](./talk/) directory contains all the relevant presentation files
and the [pcb](./pcb) directory has various PCB design projects (currently
mostly in Eagle 7).
